/**
 * This is is always executed as the last step in test generation. Difference to {@link AfterTest} is that
 * this is executed as part of the test generation process, and thus errors reported are considered part of
 * the test case. In {@link AfterTest} the errors considered general failures and not part of the test
 * generation process. Thus, for example, errors in methods with this annotation will mark a test as a failure
 * whereas errors in {@link AfterTest} mark the test generation process as a failure.
 * 
 * An example use case is to generate a set of inputs and in the end invoke test execution from the last step.
