/**
 * A test generation algorithm that is similar to the {@link RandomAlgorithm} but not preferring to take
 * a the least covered of all available transitions (randomly). The difference is that a single
 * transition is not taken many times until other available ones have been taken equally many times.
 * The same also applies to transition-pairs such that the next transition chosen is based on either the set
 * of completely uncovered transitions (with "null" source for a pair) and for a transition pair with the
 * previously taken transition as a source.
 * In summary the transition chosen is one where the source->destination transitions of a pair is one of the
 * least covered pairs. The source can be "null" meaning it is the first time ever the transition is taken.
