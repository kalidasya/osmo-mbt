/**
 * A test generation algorithm that is similar to the {@link BalancingAlgorithm}
 * but also takes into account weights assigned to transitions. For example, consider a model that has 2 transitions A and B,
 * and both have been visited twice. Now if A has a weight of 2 and B a weight of 3, the algorithm favors B due to
 * its combined weight and coverage values. 
 * The formula is: 
 * -for each possible choice: transition weight / number of times transitions covered
 * -multiply coverage values until you get a value over 1000
 * -use the resulting values as the "weight" to pick one of the transitions
 * <p/>
 * Note than in calculation, a transition that is never visited has a visited value of 1 (and one that is visited once
 * has a value of 2 and so on) to allow for simplified calculation of transition visit scores (otherwise all
 * transitions would start with score of 0, and the choices of first transitions would be random without weight).
